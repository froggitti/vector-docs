# Forking

Fork wire-os and its submodules.

## How

- Fork these repos. When choosing names, just replace the `wire-os` parts with the name you desire:
    -   [wire-os](https://github.com/os-vector/wire-os)
    -   [wire-os-victor](https://github.com/os-vector/wire-os-victor)
    -   [wire-os-externals](https://github.com/os-vector/wire-os-externals)

- Let's say, for example, we called it `diode-os`, and our GitHub username is diode123. Run in a Linux terminal:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/diode123/diode-os --recursive
```

- Replace the wire-os-victor submodule with yours:

```
cd diode-os
git rm -f anki/victor
rm -rf anki/victor .git/modules/anki/victor
git commit -m "remove wire-os"
git submodule add https://github.com/diode123/diode-os-victor anki/victor
git commit -m "new submodule"
git push
```

- You have successfully created diodeOS.
